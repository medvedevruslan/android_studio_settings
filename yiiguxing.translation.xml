On JVM it is either Android main thread dispatcher, JavaFx or Swing EDT dispatcher. It is chosen by ServiceLoader. In order to work with Main dispatcher, the following artifacts should be added to project runtime dependencies: kotlinx-coroutines-android for Android Main thread dispatcher kotlinx-coroutines-javafx for JavaFx Application thread dispatcher kotlinx-coroutines-swing for Swing EDT dispatcher In order to set a custom Main dispatcher for testing purposes, add the kotlinx-coroutines-test artifact to project test dependencies.
