The intended behavior of Up differs from Back when the user did not reach the current destination from the application's own task. e.g. if the user is viewing a document or link in the current app in an activity hosted on another app's task where the user clicked the link. In this case the current activity (determined by the context used to create this NavController) will be finished and the user will be taken to an appropriate destination in this app on its own task.

This will automatically call addCallback(OnBackPressedCallback) and remove the callback as the lifecycle state changes.

When the LifecycleOwner is destroyed, it will automatically be removed from the list of callbacks. The only time you would need to manually call OnBackPressedCallback.remove() is if you'd like to remove the callback prior to destruction of the associated lifecycle.
