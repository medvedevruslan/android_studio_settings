You can center the map on a given coordinate, specify the size of the area you want to display, and style the features of the map to fit your application's use case. Use of [MapView] requires a Mapbox API access token. Obtain an access token on the [Mapbox account page](https:www.mapbox.comstudioaccounttokens). &lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;strong&gt; Please note that you are responsible for getting permission to use the map data, and for ensuring your use adheres to the relevant terms of use." />
