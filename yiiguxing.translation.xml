      <item value="Base class for a database migration. Each migration can move between 2 versions that are defined by startVersion and endVersion. A migration can handle more than 1 version (e.g. if you have a faster path to choose when going version 3 to 5 without going to version 4). If Room opens a database at version 3 and latest version is &gt;= 5, Room will use the migration object that can migrate from 3 to 5 instead of 3 to 4 and 4 to 5. If there are not enough migrations provided to move from the current version to the latest version, Room will clear the database and recreate so even if you have no changes between 2 versions, you should still provide a Migration object to the builder." />
