      <item value="Sends the specified element to this channel, suspending the caller while the buffer of this channel is full or if it does not exist, or throws an exception if the channel is closed for send (see close for details). Closing a channel after this function has suspended does not cause this suspended send invocation to abort, because closing a channel is conceptually like sending a special &quot;close token&quot; over this channel. All elements sent over the channel are delivered in first-in first-out order. The sent element will be delivered to receivers before the close token. This suspending function is cancellable. If the Job of the current coroutine is cancelled or completed while this function is suspended, this function immediately resumes with a CancellationException. There is a prompt cancellation guarantee. If the job was cancelled while this function was suspended, it will not resume successfully. The send call can send the element to the channel, but then throw CancellationException, thus an exception should not be treated as a failure to deliver the element. See &quot;Undelivered elements&quot; section in Channel documentation for details on handling undelivered elements. Note that this function does not check for cancellation when it is not suspended. Use yield or CoroutineScope.isActive to periodically check for cancellation in tight loops if needed. This function can be used in select invocations with the onSend clause. Use trySend to try sending to this channel without waiting." />
      <item value="Performs the given action for each received element and cancels the channel after the execution of the block.

Low-priority notifications may be hidden from the user in certain situations, while the user might be interrupted for a higher-priority notification. The system sets a notification's priority based on various factors including the setPriority value. The effect may differ slightly on different platforms. On platforms Build.VERSION_CODES.O and above this value is ignored in favor of the importance value set on the notification's channel. On older platforms, this value is still used, so it is still required for apps supporting those platforms. Params: pri – Relative priority for this notification.
